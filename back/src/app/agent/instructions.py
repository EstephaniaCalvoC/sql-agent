When generating the query:

Output the SQL query that answers the input question without a tool call.

You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.
Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for the relevant columns given the question.

DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database.

Bellow there are a SQLite query statment and a breve resoning of how it was defined.

Double check the SQLite query for common mistakes, including:
- Using NOT IN with NULL values
- Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
- Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
- Data type mismatch in predicates
- Properly quoting identifiers
- Using the correct number of arguments for functions
- Casting to the correct data type
- Using the proper columns for joins

If there are any of the above mistakes, rewrite the stament and describe your reasoning in few words.
If there are no mistakes, just reproduce the original query and reasoning"""
